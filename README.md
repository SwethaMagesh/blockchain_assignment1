FAKE NEWS APP

### Features

1. Anyone is allowed to request the DApp for fact-checking a news article or item.
2. Anyone is allowed to register on the DApp as a fact-checker.
3. The fact-checkers can vote to say whether the news item is fake or not. The vote could be
 binary (0 or 1) or it could be a number over a range, say 1- 10, to indicate how truthful the
 news is (a higher number could imply that the voter thinks the news is more truthful).
4. The DApp considers all votes and outputs a single number indicating the fakeness or
 truthfulness of the news.


### REPORT - sybil, evaluate trustworthiness, more weight for some people while votin, incentive, bootstrap, upload(????)
(1) Sybil attack: A malicious person can create multiple identities and vote to skew the result in
 any direction
 (2) Method to evaluate or re-evaluate the trustworthiness of voters: The Dapp should evaluate
 how trustworthy different voters are based on how they vote. Note that someone might game
 the system to get a higher trustworthy rating. A method that is more robust to such gaming of
 the system, is preferable.
 (3) The opinions of more trustworthy voters should be given more weight. However, we must
 keep in mind that someone may be more trustworthy for certain types of news and not others.
 For example, someone may give excellent opinions about news related to Physics but is not
 so trustworthy on topics related to Politics or Economics.
 (4) Rational voters are to be incentivised to participate and vote truthfully to the best of their
 ability.
 (5) Uploading a news item: Some efficient method should be used to identify a news item (which
 is to be evaluated) in the Dapp.
 (6) Bootstrapping: If the Dapp does not have any trustworthy rating of different initial voters, then
 how to get started with fact-checking news?

### NOTES FROM ONLINE
- Sybil attack methods
Proof of Work (PoW): The most common method, PoW requires solving complex puzzles to mine blocks. This consumes computational power, making it costly to create many identities.
Proof of Stake (PoS): Users stake their own cryptocurrency to participate in the network. The more coins staked, the more influence a user has. This discourages creating fake identities as losing staked coins becomes a penalty.
Proof of Burn (PoB): Here, users destroy a certain amount of cryptocurrency to gain voting rights. Destroying valuable tokens discourages creating numerous fake identities.
